## Graph Data Stucture

`A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.`

It is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 

Mathematically, `A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.`

More precisely, a graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of
* A collection of vertices V
* A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)

### Facebook's example
Facebook use graphs to store data. Let's try to understand this through an example. On facebook, <b>*everything is a node*</b>. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, 

`Note: Anything that has data is a node.`

Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship

<b>All of facebook is then a collection of these nodes and edges. This is because facebook uses a graph data structure to store its data. </b>
