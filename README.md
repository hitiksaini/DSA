# Data-Structures and Algorithms

## What is a Data Structure ?
Data Structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

### We can learn DS by diving it in these three subdomains-
* ANALYSIS
* SORTING ALGORITHMS
* DATA STRUCTURE

## What is an Algorithm ? 
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem. In an easy saying, an algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem. They are essentially a solution.
### Qualities of a good algorithm
* Input and output should be defined precisely.
* Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
* Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
* An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.



## Analysis

### Space Complexity
Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the course of its execution. Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited memory is available.

### Time Complexity
Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its completion. It's generally a good practice to try to keep the time required minimum, so that our algorithm completes it's execution in the minimum time possible.

Note: Space and time complexity is well discussed as comments in the code(few are left, will be done soon)

## Sorting Algorithms
I have added few of the sorting algorithms more will be added soon.

## Types of DS
