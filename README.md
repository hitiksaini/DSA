Data Structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

# Terminologies in DS

## Space Complexity
Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the course of its execution. Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited memory is available.

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its completion. It's generally a good practice to try to keep the time required minimum, so that our algorithm completes it's execution in the minimum time possible.
